Nowadays has a healthy habit is something complicate because the current
lifestyle of the people let us get less time to get a healthy diet.

A healthy food was not very important for our parents because they jobs were
different. They had more physical jobs than we have now and the food was more
natural. I mean that they could use fresh food and they could make more
prepared food.

However, in our current society people are more busy and we have less time to
make food and by other hand we have supermarkets very where we can buy not very
healthy food because they are easy and fast to prepared.

In conclusion, it is very important have a healthy diet but to be honest it
is not easy get a lot of time to buy fresh food and make a prepared food.
